The ADMET analysis reveals several important aspects of drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties for the compounds examined. The average molecular weight of the candidates is relatively high at 610.52, which may impact oral bioavailability and solubility. The logP value of -1.69 suggests that these compounds have a higher hydrophilicity, which may enhance solubility but could also hinder passive membrane permeability. The drug-likeness score, as indicated by Lipinski's rule, falls at a mean of 1.00, implying that these compounds may align with one of Lipinski's criteria for favorable oral bioavailability but may not fulfill all. Additionally, the quantitative estimation of drug-likeness (QED) score is low at 0.14, indicating potential challenges in the overall drug development process. A total polar surface area (TPSA) of 269.43 indicates a relatively large hydrophilic surface area that can hinder cellular permeation.

Moreover, the metabolic liability suggests variability across different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, with CYP3A4 substrate representation at 0.41 â€” indicating a significant metabolism through this pathway, while other isoforms exhibit low substrate potential. The ClinTox score of 0.20 signifies a moderate probability of toxicity concerns, and an hERG mean value of 0.65 raises red flags for potential cardiotoxicity. To mitigate these risks and enhance the drug development potential, it is recommended to optimize the molecular weight to achieve a balance between drug-likeness and permeability, explore modifications to improve the QED score, and assess alternative scaffolding to reduce the risk of hERG channel blockade. Additionally, further investigation into metabolic pathways, particularly CYP3A4 interactions, should be prioritized to minimize adverse effects.
